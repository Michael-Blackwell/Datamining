# Datamining

Datamining final project Spring 2021

Languages: Python

1.) Download the project folder and save it to your desktop.

2.) extract the database file into the project folder.

3.) optional: download the pickle file from google drive (skip if you want to extract the features yourself (about 30 min. on my machine))

4.) update all path variables in the variables.py script

5.) should be ready to run.

if you skipped step 3 then you will need to run main.py to get the image features extracted.

once you have the features.pickle file, you are ready to run some tests. Test images can be loaded (one at a time) into the test/imgs folder. Then run predict.py (about 2 min on my machine).
